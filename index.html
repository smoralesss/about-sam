        <h1>Hey y'all! :D</h1>
        <p>My name is Samantha Imogen Morales the third, Empress of Ken-tucky</p>
        <p>let me tell you a little bit about myself!</p>
        <h2><strong>!! Fun fact alert !!</strong></h2>
        <p>I have two beautiful babies.</p>
            <div>
                <!--NR. Im taking out one of the two size dimensions, that should fix the sizing. its also handeled in the style.css page-->
                <img class="my-babes" src="my-babes.JPG" alt="my mini me's"/>
            </div>
            <p>I also have an annoying black cat; she's alright. she did commit tax evasion last year...</p>
                <div>

                    <img class="my-babes" src="cat-with-tie.jpg" alt="the IRS is still looking for him"/>
                </div>
            <p>I was raised in NM, but am originally from a small island chain in the Ken-tucky region of the pacific called Lou-i-vill</p>
        <div>
            <img class="home" src="island-chain.png" alt="home"/>
        </div>
            <p>I keep re-enrolling in school and collecting various certificates and degrees because of something called indecisiveness</p>
            <p>This is why I currently hold 4 degrees:
                <ul>
                    <li> Bachelors in Ichthyomorphic Biology </li>
                    <li> Bachelors in Dance Education, Interpretive </li>
                    <li> Bachelors in Mermaid Psycology </li>
                    <li> Doctorate in Advanced Scuba Diving </li>
                </ul>
            <p>I suppose there are worse attributes ;)</p>
            <p>Last year I found out I was being selected to become the ruler of the country!</p>
            <p>That means my son will become the duke of Rich-Mond</p>
            <p>and my daughter will become the duchess of gre-en-ville</p>
            <p>I guess I'm just like any other normal person turned royal monarch!</p>
            <p>I put my shoes on just the same as you do, the butler puts them on one foot at a time.</p>
