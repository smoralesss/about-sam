<h1>Hey y'all! :D</h1>
<p>I have two beautiful babies.</p>
<p>I also have an annoying black cat; she's alright.</p>
<p>I was raised in NM, but am originally from Louisville, KY.</p>
<h2><strong>Fun fact alert</strong></h2>
<p>I keep re-enrolling in school and collecting various certificates and degrees because of something called indecisiveness</p>
<p>I suppose there are worse attributes ;)</p>
